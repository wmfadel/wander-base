# Event Management Platform Development Guide

This guide outlines the step-by-step development process for building a complete event management platform using Go and PostgreSQL. The platform will allow users to create, view, and subscribe to events, with admins managing them. The development is structured incrementally to ensure a functional core is built first, followed by enhancements, while minimizing breaking changes.

---

## Development Roadmap

The TODO list has been organized into a logical order, prioritizing the creation of a functional core before adding advanced features. Each section below includes tasks with explanations and notes on what to study or consider before implementation. This incremental approach ensures the app remains usable throughout development and allows you to learn and apply new concepts systematically.

---

## Core Features

These tasks form the foundation of the platform, ensuring basic functionality and reliability.

1. **Better Error Handling**  
   - **Why**: Prevents the app from crashing unexpectedly and makes debugging easier by providing clear feedback.  
   - **What**: Implement error handling (e.g., using Go’s error type) and return meaningful messages to users or logs.  
   - **Note**: Study Go’s error handling conventions, such as wrapping errors with context, to adopt best practices early.

2. **Request Data Validations**  
   - **Why**: Ensures incoming data is correct and secure, preventing downstream errors or vulnerabilities.  
   - **What**: Validate fields like event names, dates, and user inputs using a library or custom logic.  
   - **Note**: Explore Go validation libraries like `github.com/go-playground/validator` for robust checks.

3. **Enhance DB Design for More Features**  
   - **Why**: A well-designed database supports current and future functionality, such as user roles and subscriptions.  
   - **What**: Create tables for users, events, and subscriptions with proper relationships (e.g., foreign keys).  
   - **Note**: Study database normalization and PostgreSQL-specific features (e.g., JSONB for flexibility).

4. **Add User Roles**  
   - **Why**: Differentiates between admins, organizers, and attendees for proper access control.  
   - **What**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.  
   - **Note**: Study RBAC principles before implementation (e.g., NIST RBAC model) to understand existing standards and avoid reinventing the wheel.

---

## Code Quality and Maintainability

These tasks improve the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend.

5. **Migrate to GORM**  
   - **Why**: Simplifies database interactions and schema migrations compared to raw SQL.  
   - **What**: Replace existing SQL queries with GORM’s ORM capabilities.  
   - **Note**: Learn GORM’s migration system to ensure smooth transitions without breaking existing data.

6. **Logging (logrus)**  
   - **Why**: Provides visibility into app behavior and errors for debugging and monitoring.  
   - **What**: Integrate structured logging with `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`.  
   - **Note**: Understand logging levels (e.g., debug, info, error) and best practices for structured logs.

7. **Testing**  
   - **Why**: Ensures code reliability and prevents regressions as features are added.  
   - **What**: Write unit tests for core logic and integration tests for API endpoints.  
   - **Note**: Study Go’s `testing` package and tools like `github.com/stretchr/testify` for effective testing strategies.

## User Experience Enhancements

These tasks focus on improving usability and engagement.

8. **Updating Events Doesn’t Need to Send All Data**  
   - **Why**: Makes updates more efficient by sending only changed fields.  
   - **What**: Use HTTP PATCH requests for partial updates instead of full PUT requests.  
   - **Note**: Learn RESTful API design principles to align with industry standards.

9. **File Upload**  
   - **Why**: Enhances events with media like images or documents.  
   - **What**: Implement file upload endpoints and store files securely (e.g., on disk or cloud storage).  
   - **Note**: Study secure file handling in Go to prevent vulnerabilities like path traversal.

10. **Notifications**  
    - **Why**: Keeps users informed about event updates or reminders.  
    - **What**: Add email or in-app notifications using a library or service.  
    - **Note**: Consider third-party services (e.g., SendGrid) or Go libraries for scalable notifications.

11. **Localization**  
    - **Why**: Expands accessibility to users in different regions.  
    - **What**: Implement multi-language support for UI and messages.  
    - **Note**: Learn about internationalization (i18n) in Go, such as `golang.org/x/text`.

## Performance and Scalability

These tasks optimize the platform for speed and growth.

12. **Caching Using Redis**  
    - **Why**: Reduces database load by storing frequently accessed data in memory.  
    - **What**: Integrate Redis to cache event details or user data.  
    - **Note**: Study caching strategies (e.g., cache-aside, write-through) and Redis basics.

13. **Rate Limiting**  
    - **Why**: Protects the API from abuse or overuse.  
    - **What**: Implement request limits per user or IP using middleware.  
    - **Note**: Explore Go rate limiting libraries like `github.com/ulule/limiter`.

14. **Background Jobs**  
    - **Why**: Offloads time-consuming tasks (e.g., sending notifications) from the main request flow.  
    - **What**: Use a job queue library like `github.com/gocraft/work`.  
    - **Note**: Understand asynchronous processing in Go for efficient job handling.

---

## Advanced Features

These tasks add sophisticated functionality to the platform.

15. **CRON (robfig/cron)**  
    - **Why**: Automates recurring tasks like sending reminders or cleaning up old events.  
    - **What**: Use `github.com/robfig/cron` to schedule jobs.  
    - **Note**: Learn cron syntax and scheduling best practices.

16. **OAuth2 Integration**  
    - **Why**: Simplifies authentication with third-party services like Google or GitHub.  
    - **What**: Add OAuth2 flows using `golang.org/x/oauth2`.  
    - **Note**: Study OAuth2 flows (e.g., authorization code grant) to ensure secure implementation.

17. **Reports**  
    - **Why**: Provides organizers with insights, like attendance stats or subscriber lists.  
    - **What**: Generate reports using SQL queries or a reporting library.  
    - **Note**: Consider exporting reports to formats like CSV or PDF for flexibility.

## Deployment and DevOps

These tasks prepare the platform for production.

18. **Dockerization**  
    - **Why**: Ensures consistent behavior across development, testing, and production environments.  
    - **What**: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app.  
    - **Note**: Learn Docker basics and multi-stage builds to optimize Go app images.

19. **CI/CD**  
    - **Why**: Automates testing and deployment for faster, safer releases.  
    - **What**: Set up a pipeline with GitHub Actions or another CI tool.  
    - **Note**: Study CI/CD workflows to integrate testing and deployment seamlessly.

20. **Hosting ([render.com](https://render.com/))**  
    - **Why**: Deploys the app to a public, scalable platform.  
    - **What**: Deploy the Dockerized app to Render or a similar service.  
    - **Note**: Understand deployment monitoring and scaling options for production.

## Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Use feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-user-roles`) for each task to keep the main branch stable and enable clean pull requests.
- **Continuous Testing**: Run tests after every significant change to catch issues early.
- **Documentation**: Maintain inline code comments and update this README as the project evolves to share knowledge with future contributors.
