# 🚀 Event Management Platform Development Guide

This guide outlines the development of an event management platform using **Go** and **PostgreSQL**. It allows users to create, view, and subscribe to events, with admins managing them. The process is incremental, building a functional core first, then adding enhancements.

## 📋 Development Roadmap

The tasks below are organized logically to ensure steady progress. Each includes a brief explanation and learning pointers.

---

## 🛠️ Core Features

Build the foundation with these essential tasks:

1. **Better Error Handling** ✅
   - Prevents crashes and aids debugging.  
   - Use Go’s `error` type for clear messages.  
   - *Learn*: Error wrapping in Go.

2. **Request Data Validations**  ✅
   - Ensures secure, valid inputs (e.g., event dates).  
   - Use a library like `go-playground/validator`.  
   - *Learn*: Input validation techniques.

3. **Enhance DB Design**  
   - Creates a scalable schema for users, events, and subscriptions.  
   - Use PostgreSQL relationships (e.g., foreign keys).  
   - *Learn*: Database normalization.

## ✨ User Experience Enhancements

Improve usability with these features:

4. **Partial Event Updates**  ✅
   - Allows efficient updates via HTTP PATCH.  
   - *Learn*: RESTful API design.

5. **File Upload**  
   - Adds event media (e.g., images).  
   - Implement secure uploads in Go.  
   - *Learn*: File handling security.

6. **Notifications**  
   - Informs users of updates (e.g., via email).  
   - Use a service like SendGrid.  
   - *Learn*: Notification libraries.

## ⚡ Performance and Scalability

Optimize for growth:

7. **Caching with Redis**  
   - Speeds up data access.  
   - Cache event details with Redis.  
   - *Learn*: Cache-aside pattern.

8. **Rate Limiting**  
   - Prevents API abuse.  
   - Use `ulule/limiter`.  
   - *Learn*: Rate limiting strategies.

## 🌐 Deployment

Prepare for production:

9. **Dockerization**  
   - Ensures consistency across environments.  
   - Write a Dockerfile.  
   - *Learn*: Docker basics.

10. **Hosting**  
    - Deploys the app publicly (e.g., on [Render](https://render.com/)).  
    - *Learn*: Deployment monitoring.
